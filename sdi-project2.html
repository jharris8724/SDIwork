    <h2>Project 2</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>My theme is a day spent at the British Museum and a pub. I chose this theme because I love London.
	Since I studied there a few years back I knew that traveling was one thing I wanted to do the 
	rest of my life. That realization also led me to this career choice because working in this field
	provides me with the skills to work just about anywhere.</p>
<p>You may also use this space to explain any elements of your code story that may not be entirely clear.  For example, if your theme is thirteenth century Italian poetry, not everyone may be familiar with that.</p>
<p>Don't forget to replace all of the capitalized elements in this template with your information.  Your term number should be in a <em>yymm</em> format, including the year and the month.</p>
