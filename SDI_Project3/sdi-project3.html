	The date is December 21, 2013. It is the one year anniversary of the darkest day in
	humanity's history. I'm talking of course of the ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE!!!
</p>
	
<p>
	There are new rules and social codes, and if you want to survive you better 
	know them. To get an idea of what it will take to make it in this new and 
	terrible world, we'll go through a day in the life of a Z.A.S. (Zombie Apocalypse
	Survivor).
</p>

<p>
	Lucky for you, today is a resupply day. That means we get to leave the safety
	of our base camp and travel out into the danger zones. Oh wait, did I say lucky?
	Well, in any case this is something you'll need to learn sooner or later so why
	not now?</p>

<p>
	To start, we'll need to take stock of what we have. Once we know what we've got,
	we'll know what we need to pick up. So you ready to get started? I sure as hell
	hope so...
</p>
<p>You may also use this space to explain any elements of your code story that may not be entirely clear.  For example, if your theme is thirteenth century Italian poetry, not everyone may be familiar with that.</p>
<p>Don't forget to replace all of the capitalized elements in this template with your information.  Your term number should be in a <em>yymm</em> format, including the year and the month.</p>
